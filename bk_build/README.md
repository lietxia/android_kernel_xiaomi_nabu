# nabu Android 16 kernel build

The default entry point is `nabu_defconfig`. The scripts do not flash, reboot,
change swap, or touch a connected device.

```sh
JOBS=4 ./bk_build/build.sh
```

The script fixes AOSP Clang 20 r547379, LLVM binutils, and pahole v1.25. It
builds the kernel and then creates and validates the AnyKernel package from
`bk_build/anykernel`. `KERNEL_DIR`, `OUT_DIR`, `DEFCONFIG`, `CLANG_DIR`,
`GCC64_DIR`, `GCC32_DIR`, and `PAHOLE` can be overridden. The local defaults
match the maintainer workstation. `nabu-perf_defconfig` is not a supported
default because it does not select `CONFIG_MACH_XIAOMI_NABU`.

Package names include the kernel release suffix:
`bk-Kernel_nabu-A16-Hyper-R2.3-HHMMSS.zip`. The ZIP contains only
files consumed by the installer. Build metadata stays under `artifacts/`; CI
generates the GitHub Release description after the build succeeds.

GitHub Actions uses the same script with pinned toolchains. The
`Build and release nabu kernel` workflow is started manually and publishes
the validated ZIP plus its SHA256 file to GitHub Releases after a successful
build. CI sets `DISABLE_LTO_CACHE=1` because the ThinLTO cache is disposable
and exceeds the hosted runner disk budget.

The packaged `dtb` follows the HyperOS vendor_boot order: `sm8150.dtb`,
`sm8150p.dtb`, `sm8150p-v2.dtb`, and `sm8150-v2.dtb`. The package targets
`nabu` and handles boot and vendor_boot separately. Restore the boot image
matching the installed system before installing from a flashed PBRP image;
the installer rejects a boot image carrying `twrpfastboot=1`.

The package embeds the fixed PBRP 4.0 recovery ramdisk from
`PBRP-nabu-4.0-20241222-2341-UNOFFICIAL.zip`. It installs that ramdisk only to
the active boot slot. It removes a hard-coded `androidboot.force_normal_boot`
value and leaves normal/recovery selection to the nabu bootloader, matching the
stock HyperOS boot header. The source ZIP and ramdisk hashes are recorded in
`bk_build/recovery/README.md` and in every build's `build-info.txt`.

The installer also places `bk-reburnout.sh` in KernelSU `service.d`. It applies
the nabu cpuset layout and swappiness 200, pins SystemUI and the display
composer to CPUs 4-7, and keeps the launcher main/rendering threads on CPUs
4-6 with CPU7 available to auxiliary workers. It enables `Re.burnout-mode`
only after a sustained CPU/GPU load. The mode raises CPU, GPU, UFS, DDR, LLCC,
and GPU-bus performance requests, exits on sustained low load or 80 C, and
restores every saved sysfs value. Create
`/data/adb/bk-kernel/Re.burnout-mode.disabled` to disable the dynamic mode;
write `1`, `0`, or `auto` to `Re.burnout-mode.force` for validation.

The installer also configures a 1 GiB zram backing loop from Android's
`/data/per_boot` area. HyperOS can initialize zram before that encrypted path
and a free loop node are ready, so the kernel permits only the first missing
backing device to be attached later without resetting active swap. Direct I/O
and a 512 MiB initial writeback budget limit flash wear. After that budget is
used, a screen-off device can add at most 256 MiB per uptime day when the 1 GiB
backing file has space. Incompressible pages are written back when the display
turns off; normal idle pages are written back after one minute.
